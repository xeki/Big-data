/**
 * An implementation of min-hashing. Logically speaking, the result of the
 * hashing is defined by the lowest index of any of the words in a permutation
 * of the universe. The universe is usually defined as the set of words which
 * are in actual use. However, it does not make any difference if we make the
 * universe larger (2^63). Many outcomes will never happen, but two outcomes
 * which are the same in a limited universe will still give the same outcomes in
 * the larger one.
 * 
 * This implementation uses a murmur3_128 hash function to 'permute' the
 * universe. Concrete, the murmur3_128 hash function works directly on the words
 * which are interpreted as indexes. The outcome of the hash function is a
 * positive long. since the output space of the murmurhash3_128 is large, and
 * the hash function of a good quality, collisions will be rather rare.
